## I am going to Israel!

I was informed of the trip back in July and I must say that I got extremely excited. Going to a place like Israel is not something that I had ever imagined. My typical vacation ideas usually include a trip to Key West, fl or orlando, fl. I am not much of a traveler.

Once I arrived at the airport my nerves started to calm. It felt as if I had never left the United States although there is definitely an extra layer of security. I quickly realized that I would have to take a taxi since Uber is not available in Israel.

### The Food!

Hummus, falafel and others. I am forever changed:

The culinary experience in Israel is amazing. As a solution engineer in sales we take customers out to eat a lot and I had the opportunity to test out several different places. I was not disappointed in any of the restaurants that we visited. I was just completely impressed. I now know what great hummus tastes like.

### Tel Aviv-Yafo

Scooters, walks and a dive in the beach:

</div>

I am from Miami and I can't help but see the resemblance between South Beach and Tel Aviv. It is definitely not an apples to apples comparison but the vibrance and energy is very similar. There are scores of people exercising at all times. In the mornings before customer visits we would go to the beach for a quick swim and it was sureal to think that I am swiming half across the globe. It was just an amazing experience!

### Jerusalem

The sites and sounds of Jarusalem:

</div>

To begin, I am not religious but respect everyone's beliefs equally. Stepping into land with so much history is both an honor and an eye opening experience.

*“It’s easily the most interesting place I have ever visited!”*

To conclude, the trip was amazing and I hope to one day return. I would like to thank [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for this great opportunity. It was a pleasure to visit this amazing place and our wonderful customers and partners.
