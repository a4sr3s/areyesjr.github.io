excerpt: Every Morning during my drive to drop off my daughter at school I listen to podcasts. I figured I would share the podcasts that I subscribe to. Spoiler alert, my top 2 are the "kubernetes podcast" and "command line heroes".

### Morning Tech News!

I don't typically listen to podcasts every morning. I am a heavy NPR listener so I usually start my day with NPR and after a couple of minutes I jump into podcasts. Apple carplay makes interacting with podcasts a real pleasant experience. Command line heroes is one of my favorite podcasts. The story telling from Saron Yitbarek and structure of the podcast really makes listening amazing. If you are in the tech space you should subscribe to Command line heroes today!

Podcasts help keep me informed in the tech world. The kubernetes podcast by Google starts every cast with a highlight of news. It does not discriminate and just cover Google news. It covers all of the news. They bring in guests from all trades and do not just focus on kubernetes they cover it all.

To conclude all of the podcasts below are great and each bring a unique value.
